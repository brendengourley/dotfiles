### Symlink or move files into home directory
The best way to do this is with [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) by simply using the following command:
```

#### Rofi
I use a side bar rofi manager for the side menu. The configs can be found in the rofi file

#### gVim
All plugins and dependencies for gVim can be installed by downloading and installing Vim Plug. Once Vim Plug is installed open Vim and run the following:
```
:PlugInstall!
```
This will install all dependencies for all Vim plugins.
